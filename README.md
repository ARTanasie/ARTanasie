### Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

### My name is **Anda-Raamona Tanasie**

I am currently an AI specialist at the Informatics department of the Fachhochschule Wiener Neustadt, where my responsibilities span Research, Development and Teaching.

With a robust academic foundation in Mathematics, Computer Science and Bioinformatics, I bring expertise in state-of-the-art Data Science and AI technologies, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Agents, RAG and Fine-tuning techniques, while keeping a strong command of classical models, ranging from linear regression to Gaussian Methods and Deep Learning architectures like RNNs and CNNs.

Passionate about education and problem-solving, I am dedicated to bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications of data science.
